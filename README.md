This is my final project of Marketing Analytics at UT MSBA, Fall 2019. 

Our team's goal is to build recommendation systems on Meetups dataset.

My teammate has built one with ALS algorithm. My goal is to build another one based on what he did, but with different algorithm and compare the performance.
